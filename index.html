                        Select two identical tiles to remove them. Once all tiles are
                        removed, the game is won.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Only open tiles can be selected, meaning that they are on top and
                        at least on one of their sides (left, right) there is no tile.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It may happen that you make a wrong move after which the game
                        cannot be won anymore.

                    <p>
                        Use the key 'h' to get a hint for a possible move. Use the key
                        'Enter' to restart the game.

                        for a description of all the 144 tiles. They fall into 7
                        categories (dots, bamboos, characters, winds, dragons, seasons,
                        flowers). Every tile appears exactly 4 times, except for the 4
                        seasons

                        which each appear only once. For this reason every pair of seasons
                        (or flowers) can be removed as well, even if they are not
                        identical.
