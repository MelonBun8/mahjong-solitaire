                    Select two identical tiles to remove them. Once all tiles are
                    removed, the game is won.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Only open tiles can be selected, meaning that they are on top and
                    at least on one of their sides (left, right) there is no tile.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It may happen that you make a wrong move after which the game
                    cannot be won anymore.

                    categories (dots, bamboos, characters, winds, dragons, seasons,
                    flowers). Every tile appears exactly 4 times, except for the 4
                    seasons

                    which each appear only once. For this reason every pair of seasons
                    (or flowers) can be removed as well, even if they are not
                    identical.
